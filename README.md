# Ozzy
# An open source discord bot made with love, made open source to encourage programmers to make bots with the package "DB-Script"
# Obvious things have been removed, such as the authorization token inside the secure folder.
# This also allows users to understand the working of the bot and report on vulnerabilities found!

# - Please read the license, the code provided CAN NOT be used to make their own version of the bot with it renamed. The main purpose is to help users understand the inner workings and understand ozzy itself, its limits, what it logs and the package used.

# - Bots found with copied code will result in LEGAL charges.
